# nextjs-todo-app
Built a next js app using next js 13 version and typescript where my tasks will be hosted
## Cool technologies I've learned here: 
* json-server : 'json-server --watch data/todos.json --port 3001'
* storing the new tasks to this server and update as well (real server)
* learned about how typescript works and their data types, return types, interface
* how modal's can be changed according to the behavior I want
* stack: tsx, daisyui, tailwindcss
* Learned how to change the daisyUI theme, cause these always refers to device's color mode which becomes dark. 
* next router/navigation; how it shows realtime data without refreshing ("cache" : 'no-store')
* learned about new "UUID" npm package that updates the new id's
